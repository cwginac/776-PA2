# CS 776: Programming Assignment 1

Use a HillClimber or other algorithm to maximize the function double eval(int *vec) contained in each of the the two object files below. These are two black box functions and I want you to try maximize both. Black box means that you do not know what the function does -- all you know is that if you send it a (int *vec) , it will return a double , greater than or equal to 0

## Installation

To compile, run the following instructions:
make 

or

make -f makefile1

or for part 2 (personal eval that hillclimber has issues with)

make -f makefile2

## Usage

To run, run the following instruction:

./main.out
